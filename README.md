# Real-Time Cryptocurrency Market Analysis with Golang and Power BI

This project demonstrates a real-time data pipeline for cryptocurrency market analysis, showcasing proficiency in Golang and Power BI.

**Key Features:**

* **Golang Backend:**
    * Fetches live market data from the CoinGecko API.
    * Extracts key metrics: price, market cap, volume, and 24-hour changes.
    * Generates timestamped CSV files for data persistence (e.g., `market_data_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.csv`).
* **Power BI Visualization:**
    * Imports and analyzes CSV data.
    * Calculates and visualizes market dominance, price volatility, trading activity, and gainers/losers.
    * Interactive dashboards with bubble charts, conditional formatting, and filters for insightful analysis.

**Utilized:**

* Golang (API integration, data processing, file handling)
* Power BI (data modeling, DAX, visualization)
* Data Engineering (data pipelines, ETL)
* Cryptocurrency Market Analysis

This project provides a practical example of building a dynamic, data-driven system for tracking and analyzing cryptocurrency market trends.
